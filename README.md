A responsive New Web's ReactJS prototype built on Flux architecture. This effort is focused on apply all the good practices and techniques to build scalable applications using "New Web's" tools, such as ReactJS, NodeJS, NPM and NPM packages.

## Instructions for build production app:

*Changes will be available to compiled.js as a minified and compressed file.*

```
npm run build
npm start
```

## Testing app:

*TBD testing mode*

## Additional info:

1. You can see diagrams and visual helps on the *images* folder.

2. In order to create a dynamic call to an API REST, you can add jQuery as a dev dependency to use the bundle **$.ajax({})** tool on the actions, or use **Node-jsx** to render server-side view-controllers.

3. App architecture:

```
